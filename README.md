UPI Sentinel: Real-Time UPI Fraud Detection System
A real-time desktop dashboard that simulates a stream of UPI transactions and uses an anomaly detection model to identify and flag potentially fraudulent activity. 

üåü Key Features
Live Simulation: Simulates a real-time feed of UPI transactions, providing a dynamic environment for fraud detection.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes an IsolationForest anomaly detection model trained on user spending patterns to identify suspicious transactions.

Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly interface built with PyQt5 that allows for real-time monitoring and analysis.

Explainable AI (XAI): When a fraudulent transaction is detected, the dashboard provides a simple, human-readable explanation for the alert (e.g., "Amount is 18810% higher than user's average").

Detailed Analytics: Click on any transaction to view detailed graphs of the user's historical spending and hourly activity patterns.

User Controls: Includes controls to pause, resume, reset the simulation, and adjust its speed for easier demonstration and analysis.

Fraud Log: A dedicated log that provides a clean, running list of all detected fraudulent transactions for a quick summary of suspicious activity.
